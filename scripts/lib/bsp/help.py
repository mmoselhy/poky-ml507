NAME
    yocto-bsp create - Create a new Yocto BSP

SYNOPSIS
    yocto-bsp create <bsp-name> <karch> [-o <DIRNAME> | --outdir <DIRNAME>]
        [-i <JSON PROPERTY FILE> | --infile <JSON PROPERTY_FILE>]

DESCRIPTION
    This command creates a Yocto BSP based on the specified
    parameters.  The new BSP will be a new Yocto BSP layer contained
    by default within the top-level directory specified as
    'meta-bsp-name'.  The -o option can be used to place the BSP layer
    in a directory with a different name and location.

    The value of the 'karch' parameter determines the set of files
    that will be generated for the BSP, along with the specific set of
    'properties' that will be used to fill out the BSP-specific
    portions of the BSP.  The possible values for the 'karch' paramter
    can be listed via 'yocto-bsp list karch'.

    The BSP-specific properties that define the values that will be
    used to generate a particular BSP can be specified on the
    command-line using the -i option and supplying a JSON object
    consisting of the set of name:value pairs needed by the BSP.

    If the -i option is not used, the user will be interactively
    prompted for each of the required property values, which will then
    be used as values for BSP generation.

    The set of properties available for a given architecture can be
    listed using the 'yocto-bsp list' command.

    Specifying -c causes the Python code generated and executed to
    create the BSP to be dumped to the 'bspgen.out' file in the
    current directory, and is useful for debugging.

    NOTE: Once created, you should add your new layer to your
    bblayers.conf file in order for it to be subsquently seen and
    modified by the yocto-kernel tool.

    NOTE for x86- and x86_64-based BSPs: The generated BSP assumes the
    presence of the of the meta-intel layer, so you should also have a
    meta-intel layer present and added to your bblayers.conf as well.

NAME
    yocto-bsp list - List available values for options and BSP properties

SYNOPSIS
    yocto-bsp list karch
    yocto-bsp list <karch> properties
            [--o <JSON PROPERTY FILE> | -outfile <JSON PROPERTY_FILE>]
    yocto-bsp list <karch> property <xxx>
            [--o <JSON PROPERTY FILE> | -outfile <JSON PROPERTY_FILE>]

DESCRIPTION
    This command enumerates the complete set of possible values for a
    specified option or property needed by the BSP creation process.

    The first form enumerates all the possible values that exist and
    can be specified for the 'karch' parameter to the 'yocto bsp
    create' command.  Example output for the 'list karch' command:

    $ yocto-bsp list karch
    Architectures available:
        arm
        powerpc
        i386
        mips
        x86_64
        qemu

    The second form enumerates all the possible properties that exist
    and must have values specified for them in the 'yocto bsp create'
    command for the given 'karch'.  This command is mainly meant to
    allow the development user interface alternatives to the default
    text-based prompting interface.  If the -o option is specified,
    the list of properties, in addition to being displayed, will be
    written to the specified file as a JSON object.  In this case, the
    object will consist of the set of name:value pairs corresponding
    to the (possibly nested) dictionary of properties defined by the
    input statements used by the BSP.  Some example output for the
    'list properties' command:

    $ yocto-bsp list arm properties
    "touchscreen" : {
        "msg" : Does your BSP have a touchscreen? (y/N)
        "default" : n
        "type" : boolean
    }
    "uboot_loadaddress" : {
        "msg" : Please specify a value for UBOOT_LOADADDRESS.
        "default" : 0x80008000
        "type" : edit
        "prio" : 40
    }
    "kernel_choice" : {
        "prio" : 10
        "default" : linux-yocto_3.2
        "depends-on" : use_default_kernel
        "depends-on-val" : n
        "msg" : Please choose the kernel to use in this BSP =>
        "type" : choicelist
        "gen" : bsp.kernel.kernels
    }
    "if kernel_choice == "linux-yocto_3.0":" : {
        "base_kbranch_linux_yocto_3_0" : {
            "prio" : 20
            "default" : yocto/standard
            "depends-on" : new_kbranch_linux_yocto_3_0
            "depends-on-val" : y
            "msg" : Please choose a machine branch to base this BSP on =>
            "type" : choicelist
            "gen" : bsp.kernel.all_branches
    }
    .
    .
    .

    Each entry in the output consists of the name of the input element
    e.g. "touchscreen", followed by the properties defined for that
    element enclosed in braces.  This information should provide
    sufficient information to create a complete user interface with.
    Two features of the scheme provide for conditional input.  First,
    if a Python "if" statement appears in place of an input element
    name, the set of enclosed input elements apply and should be
    presented to the user only if the 'if' statement evaluates to
    true.  The test in the if statement will always reference another
    input element in the list, which means that the element being
    tested should be presented to the user before the elements
    enclosed by the if block.  Secondly, in a similar way, some
    elements contain "depends-on" and depends-on-val" tags, which mean
    that the affected input element should only be presented to the
    user if the element it depends on has already been presented to
    the user and the user has selected the specified value for that
    element.

    The third form enumerates all the possible values that exist and
    can be specified for any of the enumerable properties of the given
    'karch' in the 'yocto bsp create' command.  If the -o option is
    specified, the list of values for the given property, in addition
    to being displayed, will be written to the specified file as a
    JSON object.  In this case, the object will consist of the set of
    name:value pairs corresponding to the array of property values
    associated with the property.

    $ yocto-bsp list i386 property xserver_choice
        ["xserver_vesa", "VESA xserver support"]
        ["xserver_emgd", "EMGD xserver support (proprietary)"]
        ["xserver_i915", "i915 xserver support"]

    $ yocto-bsp list arm property base_kbranch_linux_yocto_3_0
        Getting branches from remote repo git://git.yoctoproject.org/linux-yocto-3.0...
        ["yocto/base", "yocto/base"]
        ["yocto/eg20t", "yocto/eg20t"]
        ["yocto/emgd", "yocto/emgd"]
        ["yocto/emgd-1.10", "yocto/emgd-1.10"]
        ["yocto/gma500", "yocto/gma500"]
        ["yocto/pvr", "yocto/pvr"]
        ["yocto/standard/arm-versatile-926ejs", "yocto/standard/arm-versatile-926ejs"]
        ["yocto/standard/base", "yocto/standard/base"]
        ["yocto/standard/beagleboard", "yocto/standard/beagleboard"]
        ["yocto/standard/cedartrail", "yocto/standard/cedartrail"]
        .
        .
        .
        ["yocto/standard/qemu-ppc32", "yocto/standard/qemu-ppc32"]
        ["yocto/standard/routerstationpro", "yocto/standard/routerstationpro"]

    The third form as well is meant mainly for developers of
    alternative interfaces - it allows the developer to fetch the
    possible values for a given input element on-demand.  This
    on-demand capability is especially valuable for elements that
    require relatively expensive remote operations to fulfill, such as
    the example that returns the set of branches available in a remote
    git tree above.
