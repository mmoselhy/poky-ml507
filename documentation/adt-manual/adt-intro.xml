<title>Application Development Toolkit (ADT) User's Guide</title>

<para>
    Welcome to the Application Development Toolkit User’s Guide.  This manual provides 
    information that lets you get going with the ADT to develop projects using the Yocto 
    Project.
</para>

<section id='book-intro'>
    <title>Introducing the Application Development Toolkit (ADT)</title>

    <para>
        Fundamentally, the ADT consists of an architecture-specific cross-toolchain and 
        a matching sysroot that are both built by the Yocto Project build system Poky.  
        The toolchain and sysroot are based on a metadata configuration and extensions, 
        which allows you to cross-develop on the host machine for the target.
    </para>

    <para>
        Additionally, to provide an effective development platform, the Yocto Project 
        makes available and suggests other tools you can use with the ADT.  
        These other tools include the Eclipse IDE Yocto Plug-in, an emulator (QEMU), 
        and various user-space tools that greatly enhance your development experience.
    </para>

    <para>
        The resulting combination of the architecture-specific cross-toolchain and sysroot 
        along with these additional tools yields a custom-built, cross-development platform 
        for a user-targeted product.

    <para>
        This section provides a brief description of what comprises the ADT.

    <section id='the-cross-toolchain'>
        <title>The Cross-Toolchain</title>

        <para>
            The cross-toolchain consists of a cross-compiler, cross-linker, and cross-debugger 
            that are used to develop user-space applications for targeted hardware.
            This toolchain is created either by running the ADT Installer script or 
            through a Yocto Project build tree that is based on your metadata 
            configuration or extension for your targeted device.  
            The cross-toolchain works with a matching target sysroot.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section id='sysroot'>
        <title>Sysroot</title>

        <para>
            The matching target sysroot contains needed headers and libraries for generating 
            binaries that run on the target architecture.  
            The sysroot is based on the target root filesystem image that is built by 
            the Yocto Project's build system Poky and uses the same metadata configuration 
            used to build the cross-toolchain.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section id='the-qemu-emulator'>
        <title>The QEMU Emulator</title>

        <para>
            The QEMU emulator allows you to simulate your hardware while running your 
            application or image.
            QEMU is made available a number of ways:

                    available.</para></listitem>

        <title>User-Space Tools</title>

        <para>
            User-space tools are included as part of the distribution.  
            You will find these tools helpful during development.  
            The tools include LatencyTOP, PowerTOP, OProfile, Perf, SystemTap, and Lttng-ust.  
            These tools are common development tools for the Linux platform.
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem><para><emphasis>LatencyTOP:</emphasis> LatencyTOP focuses on latency 
                    that causes skips in audio,
                    stutters in your desktop experience, or situations that overload your server 
                    even when you have plenty of CPU power left.  
                    You can find out more about LatencyTOP at
